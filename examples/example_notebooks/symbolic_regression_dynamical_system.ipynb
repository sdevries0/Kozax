It is possible to select the solver, time step, number of steps and a stepsize controller to balance efficiency and accuracy. To ensure convergence of the genetic programming algorithm, constant optimization is applied to the best candidates at every generation. The constant optimization is performed with a couple of epochs of gradient-based updates using automatic differentiation in JAX. The hyperparameters that define the constant optimization are `constant_optimization_steps` (number of iterations of constant optimization for each candidate), `optimize_constants_elite` (number of candidates that constant optimization is applied to), `constant_step_size_init` (value of the step size for sampling constants) and `optimizer_class` (the optimizer used to compute gradients)."
