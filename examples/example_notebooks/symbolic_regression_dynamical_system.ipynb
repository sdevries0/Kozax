    "For the fitness function, we used the ODEFitnessFunction that uses Diffrax to integrate candidate solutions. It is possible to select the solver, time step, number of steps and a stepsize controller to balance efficiency and accuracy. To ensure convergence of the genetic programming algorithm, constant optimization is applied to the best candidates at every generation. The constant optimization is performed with a couple of simple evolutionary steps that adjust the values of the constants in a candidate. The hyperparameters that define the constant optimization are `constant_optimization_N_offspring` (number of candidates with different constants should be sampled for each candidate), `constant_optimization_steps` (number of iterations of constant optimization for each candidate), `optimize_constants_elite` (number of candidates that constant optimization is applied to), `constant_step_size_init` (initial value of the step size for sampling constants) and `constant_step_size_decay` (the rate of decrease of the step size over generations)."
